## Install

```shell
npm i -g gitam
```

## Use

Type `gam -h` or `gitam -h` in the terminal to see all the commands.

It is recommended to use the `gam` command in preference. But maybe on your device, the `gam` command is already occupied, in which case you can use the `gitam` command instead.

## Feature

- ✅ Set global/local repository git user
- ✅ Manage frequently used git users
- ✅ Quickly switch stored git users

## Example

```shell
gam add github bob bob@email.com

gam add gitlab tom tom@email.com

gam use

gam use -g
```
